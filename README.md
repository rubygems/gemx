# GemX

Ever wanted it to be easier to run a command that just so happens to come as a
gem? Yeah, @indirect too. So he nerd-sniped me into building this.

## Installation

    $ gem install gemx

## Usage

```shell
$ gemx rails new .
$ gemx --gem cocoapods -r '> 1' -r '< 1.3' -v -- pod install --no-color --help
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
